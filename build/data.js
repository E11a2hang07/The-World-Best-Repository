        introduction:'Virtual reality is the use of computer technology to create simulated environments. Virtual reality places the user inside a three-dimensional experience. Instead of viewing a screen in front of them, users are immersed in and interact with 3D worlds. Virtual Reality is not taught in most NZ high schools because it requires expensive resources and it requires a safe open space without tables and chairs. However, a basic knowledge of VR for high school students can help them expand their areas of interest, therefore I have created this site to introduce some basic virtual reality knowledge, including the uses of VR, how to use a VR device, and the history of VR.',

Non-immersive VR technology features a computer-generated virtual environment where the user simultaneously remains aware and controlled by their physical environment. Video games are a typical example of non-immersive VR. 2. Semi-Immersive Virtual Reality: This type of VR provides an experience partially based on a virtual environment. It makes sense for educational and training purposes with graphical computing and large projector systems, for example, flight simulators for pilot trainees. 3. Fully Immersive Virtual Reality: There is no fully immersive VR technology yet, but contemporary information technology is evolving very rapidly, so perhaps it will be available soon. This type of virtual reality technology produces the most realistic simulated experiences, from sight to sound and sometimes even smell.',

Here are some case examples: (1)Real Estate: Developers can create 3D models to simulate the interior of a new development, and VR technology can be used for both residential and commercial spaces. In addition, co-working spaces can also use VR technology to allow tenants to be in the space before they move in. (2) Military: VR can replace expensive and dangerous live combat exercises in simulated battles and confrontations. The ability to change scenarios makes VR attractive to all branches of the military and the defense industry. (3) Healthcare: VR can help people with anxiety or anorexia. In medical school, it can also help students learn how to cope with situations that may arise when they become doctors (e.g., empathy training). And, VR has been used for surgical training.',

This study showed that two photographs of the same object taken by the human brain from different points (one viewed by each eye) were combined to give the image the appearance of depth and immersion (three dimensions). This technique led to invention of the earliest stereoscopes by Wheatstone, which had a pair of mirrors at a 45-degree angle to the eyes of users, each reflecting an image located on the side. It eventually developed into the View-Master, patented in 1939 and still produced today.',

One of the big advances was Sensorama in 1956. Morton Heilig background was in the Hollywood movie industry. He wanted to figure out how to make people feel like they were "in" the movie. the Sensorama experience simulated a real city environment, as if you were actually "riding through" it on a motorcycle. Heilig also patented a head-mounted display device called the Telesphere Mask in 1960. Many inventors built on his innovations. By 1965, another inventor, Ivan Sutherland, had come up with the "ultimate display," a head-mounted device that he believed could serve as a "window to the virtual world. "20 In the mid-1980s, NASA Ames Research Center Virtual Interface Environment Workstation (VIEW) system combined head-mounted devices with gloves to enable haptic interaction.',

These headsets are usually connected to a headset and powered by external hardware. Its specialized display, built-in motion sensors, and external camera tracker provide high-quality sound and images, while head-tracking features allow for more realistic effects. 2. Standalone VR Headsets: All-in-one or standalone VR headsets are wireless integrated hardware, such as a tablet or cell phone. Wireless VR headsets are not always standalone. Some systems transmit information wirelessly from a nearby console or PC, while others use a wired bag in your pocket or clipped to your clothing. 3. Mobile Headsets: These shell devices use a lens that covers the smartphone. The lenses separate the screen to create a three-dimensional image, turning the smartphone into a VR device. Mobile headsets are cheaper compared to the above two because no wires are needed as the processing is done by the phone.',

Warning: If you experience any discomfort while viewing VR content, stop immediately. If you are new to VR,  do not play on VR glass for more than 10 minutes each time in order to avoid cybersickness. Not recommended children under 12 try VR headsets. Viewing 3D content can adversely affect eyesight development in children.',
